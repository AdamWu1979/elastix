# To use elastix-code in your own program, add the following

#
# set( Elastix_DIR "path/to/elastix/binary/directory" )
# find_package( Elastix REQUIRED )
# include( ${ELASTIX_USE_FILE} )
# 

# Add include dirs
include_directories( ${ELASTIX_INCLUDE_DIRS} )

# Add library dirs
link_directories( ${ELASTIX_LIBRARY_DIRS} )

# Add linking dependencies
if( Elastix_FOUND )
  # If Elastix_FOUND is set, this file has been found via find_package() which provides 
  # the ELASTIX_CONFIG_TARGETS_FILE.
